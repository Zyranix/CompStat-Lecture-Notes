    The following lecture notes are my personal (and therefore unofficial) write-up for 'Computational Statistics' aka 'CompStats',
    which took place in summer semester 2024 at Hasso-Plattner-Institut.
    I do not guarantee correctness, completeness, or anything else.
    Importantly, note that I willfully changed some specific notations, reordered some material,
    and left out parts that I didn't found worth typing down.\\
