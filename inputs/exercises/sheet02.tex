\begin{aufgabe}
Let $X_1, \dots X_k \sim Pois(m)$ independent random variables and $c \in \natnum$.
Find $h \in \natnum$ such that the probability of at least one $X_i$ satisfying $X_i + c > h$ is at most $0.01$.

For the proof we use following Chernoff bound which can be found in the accompanying book (Theorem 5.4).
\begin{fact}
    For a Poisson-distributed random variable $X$ with mean $m$ it holds for $x > m$ that
    \begin{align*}
        P(X \geq x) \leq \frac{e^{-m}(em)^x}{x^x}.
    \end{align*}
\end{fact}
\begin{proof}
    We can assume w.l.o.g. $c=0$, since it has no influence on the random variable itself.
    For $c > 0$, we can simply add $c$ to the corresponding value of $h$ if $c$ would be $0$.
    Furthermore, we can formalize the exercise quite elegantly using the inverse event that no $X_i$ satisfies the inequality, i.e. find $h$ such that
    \begin{align*}
        \prod_{i=1}^{k}P(X_i \leq h) \overset{!}{\geq} 0.99.
    \end{align*}
    Using our Chernoff bound, it holds for $h > m$ that
    \begin{align*}
        \prod_{i=1}^{k}P(X_i \leq h) = \prod_{i=1}^{k}1 - P(X_i > h) \geq \prod_{i=1}^{k}1 - P(X_i \geq h) \geq\left(1- \frac{e^{-m}(em)^{h}}{h^{h}}\right)^k.
    \end{align*}
    At this point, we need to solve the last term equaling $0.99$ for $h$ to find a valid value for $h$.
    According to WolframAlpha we need to use the Lambert W function and deduce
    \begin{align*}
        h = m\exp\left(W\left(\frac{-b}{me}\right)+1  \right), \quad b \coloneqq m + \log(1-\sqrt[k]{0.99}) < m.
    \end{align*}
    I cannot be bothered to write down if this indeed yields the wanted inequality.
    However, we can easily verify $h > m$:
    Notice that $\frac{-b}{me} > - \frac{1}{e}$, so we use $W$ on the upper branch only, on which it is strictly monotonically increasing.
    Since $W(e^{-1})=-1$, the exponent of the upper term is always greater than $0$, and thus $h > m \exp(0) = m$.
\end{proof}

\begin{aufgabe}
Let $X=(X_1,\dots, X_n), Y=(Y_1,\dots,Y_n)$ be two random strings of i.i.d characters drawn from some finite set.
The longest common subsequence is definied as the longest pair of sequences $i_1,i_2,\dots$ and $j_1,j_2,\dots$ such that $X_{i_1}=Y_{j_1}$ etc.
Also, define $Z$ as the singular long sequence of $2n$ i.i.d. random variables by concatenating $X$ to $Y$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item The expected length $l$ of the longest common subsequence satisfies $a < l < b$.
    \begin{proof}
        ddd
    \end{proof}
    \item  
    Let $h$ be the function that maps $Z$ to the length of the longest common subsequence.
    Then, following concentration result holds for any $\lambda > 0$:
    \begin{align*}
        P(|h(Z) - \expect{h(Z)}| \geq \lambda) \leq 2\exp \left(\frac{-\lambda^2}{n}\right).
    \end{align*}
    \begin{proof}
    Clearly, $h$ is $1$-Lipschitz continuous,
    since changing exactly one letter at worst increases or decreases the longest common subsequence by 1.
    Applying McDiarmid (\autoref{thm:mcdiarmid}) immediately yields our desired result (notice $Z$ uses $2n$ variables).
    \end{proof}
    \item Again, use $h$ as before.
    Following concentration result holds for the mean $m$ of $h(Z)$ and any $\lambda > 0$:
    \begin{align*}
        P(|h(Z) - m | \geq \lambda\sqrt{2m}) &\leq 4\exp\left(-\frac{\lambda^2}{4}\right).
    \end{align*}
    \begin{proof}
        We already established $h$ to be $1$-Lipschitz continuous.
        Now, use $f(s) \coloneqq 2s$. We show $h$ is $f$-certifiable.
        Assume $f(Z) \geq s$, and choose $\mathcal I$ to be the indices of $Z$ that belong to a common subsequence of length $s$ (which exists by definition).
        In particular, $|\mathcal I| = 2s \leq f(s)$, since we choose one index of $X$ and $Y$ each per length unit.
        Also, if $Z' =_{\mathcal I} Z$, then by choice of $\mathcal I$ it holds that $Z'$ contains a common subsequence of length at least $s$. Therefore, $h$ is $f$-certifiable.
    
        By Talagrand (\autoref{thm:talagrand_cert}), we can now deduce using $m$ as the median of $h(Z)$, and $\lambda > 0$
        \begin{align*}
            P(h(Z) \leq m - \lambda\sqrt{2m})P(h(X) \geq m) &\leq \exp\left(-\frac{\lambda^2}{4}\right), \\
            P(h(Z) \leq m )P(h(X) \geq m + \lambda\sqrt{2m}) &\leq \exp\left(-\frac{\lambda^2}{4}\right).
        \end{align*}
        Using $P(h(Z) \leq m), P(h(Z) \geq m) \geq \frac{1}{2}$ and adding up both cases yields
            \begin{align*}
                P(|h(Z) - m | \geq \lambda\sqrt{2m}) &\leq 4\exp\left(-\frac{\lambda^2}{4}\right).
            \end{align*}
